        <p>Scott Spencer is a 20 year old student living in North Bay, where he attends school at Nipissing Univeristy. Scott is an <b>EXTREMLY</b> handsome man that has females falling all over him 24/7,its becoming a problem. Scott went to SCFDI from grade 9-12. While there he liked to joke a lot but was an overall good student, most of the time. In grade 10 he nearly sabotaged his group project by breaking up with his girlriend via text mid project, this left him and his freind Cole in a situation where they had to restart the enire project with just the two of them instead of four. Although in grade 11 the school was stopped halfway through due to covid.</p>
